# Python Code Obfuscator

Welcome to the **Python Code Obfuscator**! This tool allows you to obfuscate your Python code using multiple layers of obfuscation techniques, making it more challenging for others to reverse-engineer or read your code.

---

## Features

- **Multi-Layered Obfuscation**:
  - Base64 encoding.
  - Hexadecimal encoding.
  - Caesar cipher character shifting.
  - Randomized variable/function names.
- **Flexible Output Options**:
  - Save obfuscated code as a `.py` file.
  - Convert obfuscated code to a standalone `.exe` using PyInstaller.
- **Ease of Use**:
  - Interactive command-line interface.
  - Simple and efficient workflow for obfuscating your Python code.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Loorwow/python_obfuscator/edit/main/README.md
   cd python-obfuscator
Install dependencies (PyInstaller is optional):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pyinstaller
Run the obfuscator:

python obfuscator.py
Enter your Python code in the interactive prompt. When finished, type END on a new line.

Choose your output format:

Option 1: Save as an obfuscated .py file.
Option 2: Convert to an executable .exe.
The obfuscated file will be saved in the current directory, or the executable will be placed in the dist folder if PyInstaller is used.
